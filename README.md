## Reporting issues, rasing suggestions for new features or enhancements
Please feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/soundengineering/RVRB/issues/new) with as much detail as you can and we'll review, triage and prioritise into the right part of the project.

## RVRB 2.0
After 1 year of use and clearer views on usage patterns, pain points from a user perspective and development bottlenecks, we've begun designing the next iteration of RVRB.
The aim is to increase stability and robustness of the platform, while allowing faster iteration of new features.

We're using githubs project function to track progress and you can view that [here](https://github.com/orgs/soundengineering/projects/1).

In time, we will add diagrams and more details to the [wiki](https://github.com/soundengineering/RVRB/wiki).

## Contributing
We're more than happy to accept contributions from anyone. Please raise a pull request on any part of the project you'd like and it will be reviewed and tested in due course.
